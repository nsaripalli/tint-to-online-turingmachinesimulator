This is a simple script to convert [tint](https://github.com/cjcodell1/tint) turing machine yaml files into and format
that can be inserted into [turingmachinesimulator.com](https://turingmachinesimulator.com/) to help with the debugging of
turing machines.

In the future perhaps I shall clean this up. But the file that you want converted should be specifed at [here](https://github.com/nsaripalli/tint-to-online-turingmachinesimulator/blob/master/main.py#L33). It will create a new file within this project directory of converted-originalfilename.extension
