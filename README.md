This is a simple script to convert [tint](https://github.com/cjcodell1/tint) turing machine yaml files into and format
that can be inserted into [turingmachinesimulator.com](https://turingmachinesimulator.com/) to help with the debugging of
turing machines.

Currently, only tested with one way 1 tape.
